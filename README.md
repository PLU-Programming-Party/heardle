# heardle
A ground-breaking new game focused on the inspiration of sound artistry and pattern recognition (no NFTs, ever).

## How we want this to work and what we want to do
- **Display to show boxes for input**
- Display of possible note names
- **Display of previous guesses with color coding**
- **Need to be able to input the note names and submit guess**
- Need to be able to play back the notes, possibly for each row
- Buttons near the possible note names to hear what the note sounds like
- Win screen! Confetti, beatmage jumping
- Game reset
